# jupyter-exploration

For the lab session, we have to createa GitHub account and a Jupter Notebook account, then link the Jupter Notebook to the Github.
When the Github is open, you can also access the Jupter one, the lab taught us how to work with both, and expanded our knowledge. Then the last thing to do was to create a word document to summarize what we did, things we learned, and faced.
